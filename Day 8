## Tip calculator

#If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. 

#Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
#Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

#Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
bill = input("What is the final bill? \n")
tip = input("What is the tip you want to give? \n")
split = input("How many of you are splitting the bill?\n")

int_bill=int(bill)
int_tip = int(tip)
int_split = int(split)

final_split= (int_bill*(1+(int_tip/100)))/int_split

print(round(final_split,2))
