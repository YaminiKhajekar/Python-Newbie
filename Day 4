## QUESTION 1

#Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
#You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
#You can return the answer in any order.

def TwoSums(num, target):
    complement_dict={}

    for i, num in enumerate(num):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in complement_dict:
            return (complement_dict[complement], i)
        
        complement_dict[num] = i 

    return []
    
    # Example usage:
num = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
result = TwoSums(num, target)
print(result)
